# PART IV — 3D ASSET SYSTEM  
## (Full, Exhaustive Version)

## 1. Overview
The 3D Asset System governs every element of vbn-game’s three‑dimensional production pipeline:
- Characters (CC5 → Blender → Cinematics)
- Props (weapons, tools, objects)
- Environments (modular structures)
- Vehicles
- Texture maps (PBR)
- Shading and rendering workflows
- Era accuracy (Phoenix, 1994)
- Visual cohesion with 2D portrait and cinematic styles

All 3D assets must align with:
- Gothic–Noir tone  
- Phoenix 1994 realism  
- Cinematic lighting  
- Location guides  
- UI integration  
- Final rendering pipeline for Blender cinematic scenes  

This section is exhaustive and covers every requirement.

# 3. Technical Standards

## 3.1 Resolution
- All 3D textures: **2048 × 2048** standard  
- 1024 × 1024 allowed for small props  
- 4096 × 4096 for hero characters or cinema close-ups  

## 3.2 PBR Workflow
Each asset requires:
- BaseColor
- Roughness
- Metallic
- Normal  
- Ambient Occlusion  
- Emission (if needed)
- Opacity (if needed)

Workflow standard:
- Metallic/Roughness PBR  
- No spec/gloss unless conversion required  

## 3.3 File Formats
- Models: FBX, OBJ  
- Textures: PNG (preferred), WEBP for UI, EXR optional  
- Blender scenes: BLEND

# 4. Character Workflow (CC5 → Blender)

## 4.1 Export Rules
From Character Creator:
- Use **4K** textures initially  
- Include A‑Pose or Neutral  
- Merge materials when appropriate  
- Export FBX for Blender  

## 4.2 Blender Setup
Upon import:
- Apply **SubD 0** during animation work  
- Set **SubD 2** ONLY at render  
- Review crease edges  
- Clean unused vertex groups  
- Confirm texture linking  

## 4.3 Skin Shading
Skin must adhere to:
- medium pore detail  
- zero plastic shine  
- slightly desaturated highlights  
- natural undertones  
- noir film influence  

Subsurface settings:
- low radius  
- soft scattering  
- maintain shadow detail  

## 4.4 Hair Shading
Hair must:
- have natural roughness  
- some dryness from desert climate  
- avoid lacquered shine
