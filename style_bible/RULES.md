### DON'T
- Bright modern LED lighting
- Futuristic architecture
- Clean, sterile visuals
- Crowded streets
- Modern vehicles (use 80s/90s only)

### Location Categories
- **Camarilla Elysium**: candlelit marble halls, gold accents, velvet curtains
- **Giovanni Scottsdale Estate**: Italian influence, candlelight, dark wood, stone floors
- **Setite Theater**: red velvet curtains, gold serpentine décor, incense haze

## 3D Asset System Rules

### DO

- Reference location guides

### DON'T
- Deviate from established shot structure
- Ignore lighting requirements

## Marketing Materials Rules

### DO

- Include version numbers
- Use descriptive filenames

### DON'T
- Inconsistent naming
- Unorganized file structures
- Ambiguous filenames

## Quest Images Rules

### DO
- Use Part XIII locked STYLE BLOCK + TECHNICAL BLOCK unchanged
- Vary only `[SUBJECT]` (and interior camera clause when needed)
- Key files to live `quests.slug`: `uploads/quests/<slug>.png|jpg|webp`
- Prefer 2.39:1 hero master; center-crop to 1:1 for quest cards
- Keep dry dust/smog Phoenix 1994 — nothing wet, nothing clean
- Align place truth with Part III and cast likeness with Part I when relevant

### DON'T
- Modify STYLE or TECHNICAL blocks without explicit ST override
- Rain-slick megacity / Hong Kong Blade Runner pastiche
- Poster/key-art/splash-art staging for quest cards
- Invent a `quests.image` DB column when filesystem-by-slug is the contract
- Treat quest stills as portrait headshots or full cinematic sequences

## Technical Requirements Summary

### Resolutions
- Portraits: 1024×1024
- Cinematics: 1920×1080
- Location Art: 1920×1080 (primary), 1024×1024 (tiles), 2048×2048 (textures)
- Quest Images: 2.39:1 hero master; 1:1 (or UI crop) for `uploads/quests/<slug>`
- 3D Textures: 2048×2048 standard

### File Formats
- Images: PNG or WEBP

- Blender: BLEND
- Textures: PNG (preferred), WEBP for UI

### Quality Standards
- No compression artifacts
- Noise subtle and filmic

- Natural undertones

## Integration Rules

All art systems must integrate with:
- Cinematic system (Part II)
- UI palette (Part V)
- Floorplan system (Part VIII)
- 3D asset system (Part IV)
- Location system (Part III)

## Enforcement

These rules are **mandatory** for all vbn-game art assets. Deviations must be approved and documented. When in doubt, refer to the full Art Bible chapters in `docs/`.
