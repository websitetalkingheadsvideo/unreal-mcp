# COLORS — COMPREHENSIVE COLOR SYSTEM

## Overview
This document defines the canonical color palette for all color-coded elements throughout the vbn-game project, including:
- Primary UI theme colors
- Clan and political faction badges
- Item type and rarity badges
- Location type and status badges
- Character status badges

All colors must maintain consistency across:
- Admin panel character listings
- Character view pages
- Badge displays in tables and cards
- CSS styling systems
- Database-driven badge rendering
- UI components and modals

## Implementation Notes

### Color Usage
- Colors are applied via CSS custom properties: `--clan-badge-color`
- Badge background uses: `background-color: var(--clan-badge-color)`
- Text color is standardized: `#f5e6d3` (Parchment Light) for readability

### Name Variations
The system supports multiple name variations for the same clan:
- "Assamite", "Banu Haqim", "Banu Haqim (Assamite)" all map to the same color
- "Followers of Set" and "Setite" map to the same color
- "Daughter of Cacophony" and "Daughters of Cacophony" map to the same color

### Fallback Behavior
If a clan or faction name is not found in the palette:
- The name is displayed as plain text (no badge)
- No color styling is applied
- HTML entities are properly escaped for security

## Integration Points

### PHP Function
The `render_clan_badge()` function in `admin/admin_panel.php` handles badge rendering:
- Accepts clan/faction name as string parameter
- Returns HTML badge with appropriate color
- Handles name normalization (lowercase, trimming)
- Supports all name variations listed above

### CSS Classes
Badge styling is defined in `css/admin_panel.css`:
- `.clan-badge` - Base badge class with padding, border-radius, font styling
- Text color: `#f5e6d3` (Parchment Light) for contrast
- Letter spacing: `0.4px` for readability

### Database Integration
Clan names stored in the database should match the palette keys (case-insensitive) for proper badge rendering.

---

## Color Selection Rationale

### Clan Colors
- Colors are chosen to reflect clan themes and lore
- Each color is distinct enough to avoid confusion
- Colors work well on dark backgrounds (site theme)
- High contrast with text color for accessibility

### Political Faction Colors
- **Anarch** (`#DC143C`): Crimson represents rebellion and revolution
- **Camarilla** (`#8B6508`): Bronze Gold represents tradition, authority, and establishment
- **Sabbat** (`#1A0F0F`): Dusk Brown-Black represents darkness, chaos, and the sect's brutal nature

---

## Maintenance

When adding new clans or factions:
1. Add color entry to the palette in `admin/admin_panel.php`
2. Update this documentation
3. Test badge rendering in admin panel
4. Verify color contrast for accessibility
5. Ensure color doesn't conflict with existing palette

## CSS Variables

The primary UI colors are also defined as CSS custom properties in `css/global.css`:

```css
--bg-dark: #0d0606;
--bg-darker: #1a0f0f;
--deep-maroon: #2a1515;
--dusk-brown-black: #1a0f0f;
--blood-red: #8B0000;
--muted-gold: #d4b06d;
--teal-moonlight: #0B3C49;
--text-light: #f5e6d3;
--text-mid: #d4b06d;
```

Use these CSS variables in stylesheets for consistency across the project.
