# PART VIII — FLOORPLAN & BLUEPRINT SYSTEM  
## (Full, Exhaustive Version)

## 1. Overview
The Floorplan & Blueprint System defines all top‑down architectural representations used in vbn-game:
- Havens
- Locations
- Organization headquarters
- Elysium layouts
- Desert outposts
- Institutional zones
- Dungeon-like structures
- Setite theater interiors
- Giovanni estate architecture

Floorplans provide a unified visual language for:
- storytelling reference
- UI presentation
- cinematic layout planning
- game design
- location consistency

This section is exhaustive and binds all spatial logic across the chronicle.

# 2. Visual Philosophy

## 2.1 Blueprint Identity
All vbn-game maps follow a strict noir‑blueprint hybrid style:
- gold linework on black backgrounds  
- parchment linework on parchment backgrounds  
- clean, readable schematics  
- gothic border motifs allowed  
- subtle vignette  

## 2.2 Aesthetic Themes
Floorplans must feel:
- old  
- functional  
- secretive  
- architectural  
- noir  
- dramatic  

They convey a hidden world layered beneath Phoenix 1994.

## 2.3 Forbidden Aesthetics
Do NOT use:
- neon outlines  
- brightly colored rooms  
- modern CAD-perfect lines  
- cute icons  
- isometric perspective  

All maps must be **flat, top-down, architecturally grounded.**
